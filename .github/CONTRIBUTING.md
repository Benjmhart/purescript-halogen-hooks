# Contribution

Thank you for contributing to Halogen Hooks!

Following these guidelines helps ensure I'm able to carefully consider your contribution and help you finalize your pull request. Your time (like mine) is valuable, and I try to at least provide constructive feedback on every contribution.

### Contributions I love

Halogen Hooks is an open-source library and I love to receive contributions. There are many ways you can contribute:

* Help expand test coverage
* Help fix open issues, even if that simply means adding a helpful comment
* Help push along open pull requests that need more work to be complete
* Improve or add new usage examples to better demonstrate how to use the library in real-world scenarios
* Update documentation and tutorials to be easier to understand, more comprehensive, and above all -- up to date!

### Contributions I should discuss

Some contributions will take some discussion before I accept an update to the project. If your contribution includes one of the below examples (or seems to be reasonably similar), please consider reaching out to us before putting in a lot of work to build the feature. I'm active on the [PureScript user forum](https://discourse.purescript.org) and the [functional programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/) community (new? [use this link to join](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/)!). For feature requests, feel free to open an issue with a tag.

* New features and functions that will change the library's public API
* New tutorials (while I love seeing new tutorials, I won't always be able to feature them in the readme)

# Ground Rules

I have a small set of quality-of-life guidelines for contributing to Halogen Hooks. These include:

* All pull requests must pass continuous integration.
* If you are adding new functionality, you should provide tests and documentation for your code. If you're fixing an existing bug, please provide a failing test case your patch solves.
* If possible, please avoid requiring new dependencies.

### Filing issues

If you have a general question about the project, it's best to ask on the [PureScript user forum](https://discourse.purescript.org) or the [functional programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/) than to open a new issue. If you ask there and have no answer, then please do feel free to open an issue on this project.

If you have run into a bug in the project, please open an issue! When you do, I ask that you follow a few steps which are outlined in the issues template. The gist of it is here:

* Verify the problem is indeed with Halogen Hooks (not with Pulp, Spago, PureScript, or Halogen);
* Record what versions you are using for PureScript and Halogen Hooks
* Describe the issue with steps to reproduce (as much as you are able). A minimal reproducible example is the absolute best case scenario.

I promise to address the issue as soon as I can.

### Suggesting features or enhancements

I love to hear about ways I could make  better. If you're wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Halogen Hooks, you're probably not alone; there are bound to be others with similar needs. Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub that describes:

* the feature you would like to see
* why you need it
* how it should work

I promise to review your issue, but I'm not always able to accommodate all requests. It helps if you're able to contribute to the implementation, too!
